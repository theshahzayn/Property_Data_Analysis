# Property_Data_Analysis

## 1. Dataset Information

### Dataset Selection

We have chosen the "Online Property Dataset of Pakistan (2019)" available at [Property Data for Pakistan - Zameen Updated.csv - Open Data Pakistan](link_to_dataset).

### Dataset Dimensions

The dataset comprises information related to online property listings in Pakistan, with over 1.5 lakh rows. Our goal is to explore this extensive dataset, derive valuable insights, and potentially develop machine learning models.

## 2. Project Goals

### Data Cleaning and Preparation

Using pandas, we will:
- Check for missing values and apply appropriate methods for handling them.
- Ensure no invalid values exist in any column.
- Convert strings to numeric data where necessary.

### Descriptive Statistics and Visualization

We will leverage statistics and visualization techniques using Matplotlib and NumPy to:
- Analyze trends in property listings over time and across different regions.
- Explore the distribution of properties based on factors such as property types, purpose, and location.
- Investigate correlations between different features, such as property prices, baths, and bedrooms.
- Examine how property prices change over the years.
- Identify cities or provinces with the highest and lowest property prices.
- Explore correlations between different features through graphical representations.
- Analyze the overall trend in the number of property listings over the years.

### Machine Learning Tasks (Potential)

Depending on the progress and dataset characteristics, we may delve into machine learning tasks such as:
- Predicting property prices based on features like bedrooms, baths, and area.
- Classifying property types (e.g., residential, commercial) using various features.
